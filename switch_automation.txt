To backup the startup-config of a Cisco network switch using Ansible to a TFTP server, you can use the ios_command module to execute the copy command on the switch. Here are the steps to do so:

Install the necessary networking modules: To manage network devices with Ansible, you need to install some additional modules.

You can install the networking modules using the following command:

Copy code
sudo ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.netcommon
This will install the ansible.netcommon collection, which includes networking modules for Ansible.

Create an Ansible playbook: Create an Ansible playbook (e.g. backup-startup-config.yml) to backup the startup-config of the switch to the TFTP server.

Here is an example playbook:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Backup startup-config of Cisco switch
  hosts: network_switches
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Backup startup-config to TFTP server
      ios_command:
        commands:
          - copy startup-config tftp://<TFTP_SERVER_IP>/backup/startup-config.cfg
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "<USERNAME>"
          password: "<PASSWORD>"
      register: copy_result

    - name: Print copy result
      debug:
        var: copy_result.stdout_lines
This playbook uses the ios_command module to execute the copy command on the switch. The commands parameter specifies the copy command to be executed. The provider parameter specifies the login credentials of the switch.

Configure Ansible inventory: Ansible inventory is used to define the list of hosts that you want to manage with Ansible.

Create an inventory file (e.g. inventory.ini) and add the IP address of your network switch to it, for example:

csharp
Copy code
[network_switches]
192.168.1.1
Run Ansible playbook: To run the playbook, use the ansible-playbook command:

arduino
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini backup-startup-config.yml
This will execute the backup-startup-config.yml playbook against the host defined in the inventory.ini file.

Once the playbook has finished running, the startup-config of the switch should be backed up to the TFTP server at the specified location. You can check the copy_result.stdout_lines output to verify the status of the backup process.
